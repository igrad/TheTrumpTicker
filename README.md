## Contributions are welcome!
For feature enhancements, bug reports, errata to the data points listed on the site, etc, please feel free to visit the Discussions section. If others agree that it's something we want to move forward with, we'll create an Issue and eventually a PR to bring the changes into mainline.

Currently, we would love contributions on:
* The overall layout and design (note that minimalism and clarity of message are paramount in the design of this site)
* Code cleanup and optimization
* Charity recommendations, especially charities that help disenfranchised or oppressed communities, either in the U.S. or abroad.
