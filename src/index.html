Hey nerd. If you're interested in helping improve this page, check out the Github link in the footer. I'd be happy to have your help! I'm not a web developer - this whole site is cobbled together with ChatGPT snippets and Elmer's glue, so a professional touch could go a long way.
If you have any ideas to improve the site overall, but don't directly want to work on it, that's cool too. Just leave a note on the Issues section to recommend an approvement, and if I like it, I'll put it on the docket.
Have a great day :)
