Hey nerd. If you're interested in helping improve this page, check out the Github link in the footer. I'd be happy to have your help! I'm not a web developer - this whole site is cobbled together with ChatGPT snippets and gluesticks, so a professional touch could go a long way.
If you have any ideas to improve the site overall, but don't directly want to work on it, that's cool too. Just leave a note on the Issues section to recommend an improvement.
Have a great day :)

                    New Door Ventures helps at-risk youth get ready for work and life. Through real opportunities to work and learn, we provide assistance to young people ages 16-21 who need support in making the increasingly difficult transition to adulthood. We provide youth with the meaningful jobs and training that they need to succeed in the workplace, and the personal support they need for the rest of life. We offer a comprehensive approach to helping youth succeed through: jobs, job readiness, supportive community.

                    Center on Halsted advances community and secures the health and well-being of the LGBTQ people of Chicagoland and throughout the Midwest. Though Center on Halsted's building opened in 2007, our history goes back much further. We were known as Horizons Community Services, the Midwest's largest LGBTQ social service agency. We are proud of our legacy of advocacy, support, and educational servicesâ€”the same services that helped form the core of Center on Halsted's programming.
